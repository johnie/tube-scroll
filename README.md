Animate metro maps by scrolling

This project has been created as a scaled up project to this 
<a href="http://codepen.io/paintbycode/details/JDbcF" target="_blank">demo</a> I created on CodePen.</p> 

The site has been tested on the latest versions of Firefox, Safari, Chrome & Opera as well as 
iOS6+ Safari, Android 4.0+ & Chrome for Android.

You will find that on iPhones & iPads that the scrolling animation isn't as smooth as on 
other devices and browsers, this is due to the way iOS handles scrolling. However this is 
due to be rectified in iOS 8.

Tube Scroll lets you animate simplified SVG metro maps by scrolling.

Simply pick a metro system below and start scrolling.
